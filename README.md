### Learning Objective(s):

- Understand how governance plays a role in the path to production

- See how reusable templates make developer's life easier

- Understand how DevSecOps practices can be easily achieved

# Lab 5: Multicloud Deployments

## Summary
Our SRE team wants to increase resiliency by adopting multi-cloud deployments. AWS EKS joins our GCP GKE deployment. Twice the clouds, twice the resilience, same amount of effort. (That last part is actually true.) The platform team has already created the EKS cluster for us, but we need to create a new namespace for our application.

### Learning Objective(s):

- Managed Infrastructure as Code (IaCM) via templates and workspaces

- Dynamic environment provisioning in the delivery pipeline

- Multi-environment deployments with parallel execution

- Configure environment-specific settings without duplicating services with Overrides

## Steps

### Infrastructure as Code Management

1. From the left navigation bar, expand **Infrastructure** and click on **Workspaces**

2. Click on **Start with Template** and name it `{project-id}-workspace`

3. Select the **IaCM Workspace Template** and click **Use Template**

4. Click on the **Configuration** section. Review the pre-created workspace settings—our provisioner and repo containing the Terraform code has already been configured for us.

5. Now click on **Connectors and Variables**. The name for the target namespace we will deploy to has been prepopulated with a default value.

> **Note:** Any and all of these settings can be made editable by the template owners, giving flexibility where needed and standardization where warranted.

### IaC Orchestration in the Pipeline

1. Now let's head back to our pipeline. Click **Pipelines** from the top of the left navigation menu and select our **workshop** pipeline.

2. Before our frontend deployment stage, add an **Infrastructure** stage, name it `Create K8s Namespace`, and click **Set Up Stage**.

3. Click **Next** on the Infrastructure section—**Cloud** should already be selected for you.

4. Select the workspace you just created: `{project-id}-workspace`

5. Ensure the Provisioner is set to **OpenTofu** and the Operation is **Provision**, then click **Use Strategy**.

6. Between the **plan** and **apply** steps, click the plus button and add an **IaCM Approval** step. Name it `IaCM Approval` and check the box for **Auto approve when the plan does not change**, then click **Apply Changes** at the top right.

### Multi-Environment Deployment

1. Click on the **frontend** stage and select the **Environment** tab.

2. Flip the toggle **Deploy to multiple Environments or Infrastructures** to on and select **Apply Changes**.

3. On the **Infrastructures** section, click on the box **Specify Infrastructures** and select `EKS`. Click **Apply Selected**.

4. Save the pipeline.

### Environment Overrides

> **Note:** Our K8s manifest has GKE-specific properties which would cause our EKS deployment to fail. Let's override them.

1. From the left navigation bar, expand the **Deployments** section and select **Overrides**.

2. Select the **Service & Infrastructure Specific** section and then click on **New Override** and complete with the following:

   | Input | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Environment | prod |
   | Infrastructure | EKS |
   | Service | frontend |
   | Identifier | prod_frontend_eks |
   | Code Source | Inline |

3. Click on **New** beneath **Override Type** and select **Manifest**, then complete as follows:

   | Input | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Manifest Type | Values YAML |
   | YAML Store | Code |
   | Manifest Identifier | EKS |
   | Repository Name | harnessrepo |
   | Branch | main |
   | File Path | harness-deploy/values-eks.yaml |

4. Click **Submit** and then on the checkmark on the right to apply changes.

> **Bonus:** Repeat for the backend service and edit the backend stage to also include EKS as a deployment target.

2. From the left hand side menu select pipelines and drill down to the existing pipeline

3. In the existing pipeline, within the Deploy backend stage **after** Canary Deployment and **before** the approval step click on the plus icon to add a new step

4. Add a **Verify** step with the following configuration

   | Input | Value | Notes |
   | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Verify | |
   | Continuous Verification Type | Canary | |
   | Sensitivity | High | *This is to define how sensitive the ML algorithms are going to be on deviation from the baseline* |
   | Duration | 5mins | |

5. Under the verify step click on the plus icon to add a new step in parallel

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-28 at 14 28 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/368ba808-d303-43f8-8824-5d2e09367b01)

8. Click **Save**

# Lab 6 - Release Validation & Automatic Rollback

## Summary
Validate release using Continuous Verification

### Learning Objective(s):
- Use complex deployment strategies to reduce the blast radius
- Add continuous verification to the deployed service
- Automate release validation
- Rollback unstable releases

### Outcomes
- Force failure of continuous delivery validation using chaos engineering

## Steps

-----------
1. **TODO** write the steps to update the backend service to "backend-v2"
-----------

2. Click **Run** to execute the pipeline with the following inputs. As a bonus, save your inputs as an Input Set before executing (see below)

   | Input | Value | Notes |
   | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | Branch Name | main | *Leave as is* |

3. While the canary deployment is ongoing navigate to the web page and see if you can spot the canary (use the check release button) 

   | project                | domain        | suffix |
   | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
   | http\://\<project\_id> | .cie-bootcamp | .co.uk |

- Validate that we've deployed the new version in the canary by checking the version is **backend-v2** and the Last Execution matches the **build Id** of your pipeline

------
**TODO** insert screenshot of canary with v2 and where to find the build Id
------

- Drill down to the distribution test tab and run the traffic generation by clicking the **Start** button

- Observe the traffic distribution

- Validate the outcome of the verification on the pipeline execution details

**Bonus**:
- If the verification fails harness defaults to a manual intervention, you can now decide what you want to happen next (rollback, ignore etc.) 

- Add a canary rollout from 10% to 50% traffic and see how this impacts the traffic distribution


# Lab 7 - Governance/Policy as Code

# Lab 8 - Governance/Policy as Code (Advanced)

### Summary
Create advanced policies to block critical CVEs and enforce security standards

### Learning Objective(s):

- Integrate policy enforcement into pipelines

**Steps**

**Create a Policy to block critical CVEs**

1. From the secondary menu, select **Project Settings** and select **Policies**

2. Select the **Policies** tab 

3. click **+ New Policy**, set the name to **Runtime OWASP CVEs** and click **Apply**

4. Set the rego to the following and click **Save**

<!---->

    package pipeline_environment
    deny[sprintf("Node OSS Can't contain any critical vulnerability '%d'", [input.NODE_OSS_CRITICAL_COUNT])] {  
       input.NODE_OSS_CRITICAL_COUNT != 0
    }

5. Select the **Policy Sets** tab

6. Click **+ New Policy Set** and configure as follows

   | Input | Value | Notes |
   | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Criticals Not Allowed | |
   | Entity Type | Custom | |
   | Event Evaluation | On Step | |
   | Policy Evaluation Criteria | | |
   | Policy to Evaluate | Runtime OWASP CVEs | |

7. For the new policy set, toggle the **Enforced** button

**Add Policy to Pipeline**

   | Input | Value | Notes |
   | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Policy - No Critical CVEs | |
   | Entity Type | Custom | |
   | Policy Set | Criticals Now Allowed | *Make sure to select the Project tab in order to see your Policy Set* |
   | Payload | {"NODE_OSS_CRITICAL_COUNT": _\<variable>_} | *Set the field type to Expression, then replace _\<variable>_ with OWASP output variable CRITICAL. Go to a previous execution to copy the variable path.* |

5. Save the pipeline and execute. Note that the pipeline fails at the policy evaluation step due to critical vulnerabilities being found by OWASP.
