**Test the Policy to require Approvals**

1. Open your pipeline

2. Try to run the pipeline and note that the failure due to lack of an approval stage

3. Click **Save** and note that the failure due to lack of an approval stage

4. Open the pipeline in edit mode and navigate to the “**frontend**” stage

5. Before the rolling deployment step add **Harness Approval** step according to the table  below

   | Entity Type | Custom | |
   | Policy Set | Criticals Now Allowed | *Make sure to select the Project tab in order to see your Policy Set* |
   | Payload | {"NODE_OSS_CRITICAL_COUNT": _\<variable>_} | *Set the field type to Expression, then replace _\<variable>_ with OWASP output variable CRITICAL. Go to a previous execution to copy the variable path.* |

5. Save the pipeline and execute. Note that the pipeline fails at the policy evaluation step due to critical vulnerabilities being found by OWASP.
